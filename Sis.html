<center> <h1> <br> <br> <br> Sis  </h1>


<p>  When I am crying upset day/ night, <br>
 She is the one sitting by my side. <br>
Not letting me lose any hope, <br>
Making me smile by her silly joke. </p>


<p> More than sister she is my best friend, <br>
With whom most of the time I spend. <br>
She is unique and special, <br>
With two sides of her sweet and rebel. </p>


<p>  I know if the world is against me by my side she will stand, <br>
 Being the only one to lend out her hand. <br>
She is my best friend, sister and guide, <br>
 In front of her I got nothing to hide. </p>
