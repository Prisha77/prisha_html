<br> <br> <br> <center> <h1> EARTH</h1> 

<p>You and I believe I was made by the almighty,<br> 
       And all he asked in return was to keep me neat and tidy. <br>
       I  remember the days I used to be all green, <br>
       But you all ruined me by not keeping me clean. </p>


                     <p> I have seen a million people throw garbage on me, <br>
                            The rest million ignore even after all the garbage they see.<br>
                             I have seen slogans of Clean Earth, <br>
                             Yet no one waters me to quench my thirst. </p>


<p> I have provided you with everything you need, <br>
       The least you could do is plant a seed. <br>
        I have seen all kinds of pollution- water, land, air , <br>
        All I can say is treat me with care. </p>


                          <p> I have lived with all kinds of animals and human being, <br>
                            And over years dirt is all I am seeing  . <br>
                            Your decision about going to mars I know, <br>
                             Now nobody cares about me what I'll do, Where I'll go? </p>
