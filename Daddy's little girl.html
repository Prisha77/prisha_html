<center> <h1> <br> <br> <br> Daddy's little girl  </h1>


<p>  I know you feel those old days are gone, <br>
 When you used to sit beside me and tell stories till dawn. <br>
 Teaching me alphabet and playing old games, <br>
But now for you only the memory remains. </p>


<p>  I know you miss carrying me around on your shoulder, <br>
Wishing I did not get any older. <br>
You think your daddy's little girl has aged, <br>
But how to tell you 'I never changed'. </p>


<p>  I know you still fear I will leave you, <br>
 But you can trust me that will never be true. <br>
You sometimes wish again I were a child, <br>
 Miss the way I talked and smiled. </p>


<p>   I know you think I am mature and grown, <br>
Thinking your daddy's little girl is now unknown. <br>
And there is on.y one thing I can say, <br>
Your daddy's little girl didn't fade away. </p>
