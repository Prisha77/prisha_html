<p> They thought to the family I brought disgrace, <br>
    To them I was a piece of waste. <br>
    What will I do just become a burden, <br>
    Always be the unlucky one. </p>


<p> Education is something not for me, <br>
    Might become rebel and fight to be free. <br>
    As soon as I am a teen get me married, <br>
    Give away the burden you carried. </p>


<p> Don't care about me now I am not your kid, <br>
    Your job is done, you did what you did. <br>
    I will suffer with them like I did with you, <br>
    Cause this is my job, all I have to go through. </p>



<p> I am a woman stronger than many, equal to all, <br>
    Give me an oppurtunity to stand tall. <br>
    Appreciate the work I do, <br>
    Cause it is always easy to critisize the work you veiw. </p>
