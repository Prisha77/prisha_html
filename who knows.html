<center> <h1> <br> <br> <br> Who knows  </h1>




<p> She sits inside her room <br>
Who knows what she is doing <br>
What she thinks in her little mind <br>
Wish I knew her side of viewing </p>
 
                                                       <p>   Never talks to anyone <br>
                                                         Just writes in her small book <br>
                                                         Sitting far from everyone <br>
                                                         Just gives a shy look </p>
 
<p> She got everything she needs <br>
But all she wants is her privacy <br>
She has all the freedom in world <br>
NO ENTRY IN ROOM is her only policy </p>
 
                                         <p>  You do trust her <br>
                                           And she is happy in her world <br>
                                           Silent and happy <br>
                                           is what you observed. </p>
