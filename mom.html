<center> <h1> <br> <br> <br> Mom  </h1>


<p>  When I was about to fall she held my finger. <br>
 How she manages everything, That's what I wonder. </p>


<p>  She stopped me from doing anything wrong. <br>
Taught me values and the way to be strong. </p>


<p>  She is talented no doubt about it. <br>
 She does everything to what she has commit. </p>


<p>  Any situation that comes to her she handles it smartly. <br>
Even if it is created by me, didi or her partly. </p>
 
 

<p>  She taught me how to get through rough stuff. <br>
 And for this any thank you gift wouldn't be enough. </p>
