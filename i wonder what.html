<center> <h1> <br> <br> <br> I wonder what </h1>


<p>  Many fans in front and back of me, <br>
 Asking for an autograph and a selfie you see. <br>
  I wonder what it would feel like as a star, <br>
 Doing films and traveling world so far. </p>


<p>  Helping patients as my family, <br>
Saving people is what I do happily. <br>
I wonder what it would feel like as a doctor , <br>
You think it will be more fun than an actor. </p>


<p>  Helping children study for their future, <br>
 I wonder what it would feel like as a teacher. <br>
  Lighting their way to success, <br>
 Helping them in their hard process. </p>


<p>   I wonder what my future job would be, <br>
I know none of these will be easy. <br>
I dont know if it will be cool/ crappy, <br>
But in the end I just want to be happy. </p>
