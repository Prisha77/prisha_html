<center> <h1> <br> <br> <br> Life </h1>

<p> It all begins with you in a cradle <br>

With no worries of your future being dull, <br>

All around you ready to play <br>

Making you sleep night and day. </p>

 

                                   <p> Just in one blink you are in your teens   <br>

                                  Getting to know what life really means, <br>

                                  Now you know you are starting to change <br>

                                 Having all mood swings are a little strange. </p>

 

<p> Now you are a youth with real responsibility <br>

Where getting a job depends on your capability, <br>

Money is what you run after <br>

And dear ones now don’t matter. </p>

 

                                      <p> Now you are getting old <br>

                                  Realizing your past was gold, <br>

                                 Never gonna get the loved ones back <br>

                                Now you know in life happiness is what u lack. </p>
